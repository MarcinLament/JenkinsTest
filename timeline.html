        <p><b>Welcome to your new timeline</b></p>
        <p>Timeline is the story of your finances. It's a tool that maps up to 5 years of your credit history.</p>
        
        <p><b>Watch your score history grow</b></p>

        <p>The small dots you'll see on your Timeline signify key events in your credit history. New credit accounts, updated limits and score changes - it's all here in clear view.</p>

        <p><b>Zoom in on specific moments</b></p>
        <p>Get to know your finances inside out. Simply tap on an event to see what happened, when and why.</p>
